Binary files in a git repo????
------------------------------
That's the purpose of this repo. We'll delete it if it gets too big.

Speaker test
------------
The files named speaker_test*.avi are intended to test surround setups, as well
as media player audio downmixing. The file gen.py was used to generates these
files. The avi file format is used, because it seems to be the only format that
ffmpeg can read/write correctly and which supports all possible audio channel
layouts, even extremely obscure ones.
